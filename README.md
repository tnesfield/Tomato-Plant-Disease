# What’s Wrong With My Tomato Plant?!?!
## A convolutional neural network solution to determine diseases in tomato plants.

## Introduction 
Growing tomato plants can be more effecitve if you know how to look for various diseases and pests. Often tomato plants can succumb to problems and unfortunately get misdiagnosed. Misuse of chemicals can lead to the emergence of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts.  Diagnosging these diseases can be time consuming and expensive.

* 93% of American gardening households grow tomatoes! It’s the most popular vegetable in the US.
* 96% of the American processed tomato production comes from California. Florida is the leader in the production and sale of fresh market tomatoes.
